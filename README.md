## Purpose
In this project I want to implement a simple authentification server that stores users/logins and the amount of credits each user has. This could be done with a simple array or it I could implement a database for that. 
Secondly I want to implement the VEO 3 API calls with the correct prompt. They should be tied to the user because it only works if the user has enough credits.
